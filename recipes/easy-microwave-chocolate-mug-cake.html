    <h5><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241038/microwave-chocolate-mug-cake/">Recipe source</a></h5>
    <p>This chocolate mug cake is made in the microwave for a fudgy, chocolaty treat that is truly decadent. It's a
        great recipe for nights when I need a yummy dessert that's ready in less than 10 minutes! Add a few chocolate
        chips to make it extra rich and gooey.</p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large microwave-safe mug; stir in milk, canola oil, water, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>Cook in the microwave until cake is done in the middle, about 1 minute 45 seconds.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>VARIATION</h3>
    <p>For a healthier version, use 1 1/2 tablespoons of plain unsweetened applesauce instead of canola oil, and use 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon of water instead of milk.</p>
